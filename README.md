# Nagios
Nagios monitoring configuration files for SuperDARN hardware and networks.

## Installation
Nagios installation instructions can be found [here:](https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/quickstart.html)

Instructions for installing and using NRPE can be found in [this](https://github.com/SuperDARNCanada/Nagios/blob/master/NRPE.pdf) PDF file. To properly use NRPE, you'll need to specify allowed hosts in the nrpe.cfg file. I've used hostnames here, but they can be IP addresses too.
